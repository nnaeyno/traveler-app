Django Traveler App
Travel helper app - user authenticates and they have a "workspace" for traveling with friends. 
Others can access the "workspace," get Google Maps API so they can put pins on the map where they 
want to go. It can be a live map where other people's pins show up in real-time, and when you click 
on the pin it can have live discussions or chats or comments. A separate place where you can have 
all the tickets and documents for traveling and another where you can have a list of your luggage.
